# Feature ideas (priority order)
* [blocked on PetPoint Case #00429913] Make "see DBS notes" render inline instead of in a popup
* Enable BPA mode (defaults to BPA role, adds BPA-specific dropdowns)
* Enable PG mode
* Fix how "expires in" displays on DBS notes
* Fix puppy detection on DBS list (is a little off in the 5mo 20d case)
* Converge the green list and the normal DBS list by implementing a "priority" pet ID of some sort
* Add a RDR marker to the DBS list
* Automate the RDR list (or converge it with DBS list)
* Automatically color code the DBS list
* Make a kong list that automatically counts dogs by size/diet
* Figure out a way to make it easier to scan past notes for observations
* Fix issue where, on session expiry (by waiting 10 minutes and going to Pick an Animal), you don't return to the correct page
* Debug this bug report:
    "we fat fingered our way about six times into a Dog Search screen that didn't have the Name field -- only the Animal ID field --- the dog name was prefilled into Animal ID.  I tried to recreate the sequence of events that got us there but couldn't figure it out -- sorry.  The solution was to just hit Search and the screen refreshed so we could start over --- so it's not a big deal, but I thought I'd let you know in case anyone saw the same thing."
* Consider adding some of the new holds to the DBS list/notes
* Make a 1-click "generate DBS list" button
* Audit all color coding across all reports for consistency
* Add nightly UI tests to protect against PetPoint making a breaking change
* Enable editing of recently left notes
* Add a support/suggestions form
* Add 'Seattle Humane DBS' logo alongside PetPoint's
* Show the just-enterred note info on the "add note" confirmation screen
